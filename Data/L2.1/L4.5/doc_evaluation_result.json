        "monitoring_scope_and_focus": "OpenAI describes monitoring in terms of system reliability, safety, and abuse detection, framing it as oversight of model and platform behavior rather than continuous surveillance of individual users.",
        "data_used_for_monitoring": "The documentation refers to logs, safety signals, security telemetry, and aggregated usage, and the system card emphasizes limited retention and lack of routine human review of user content.",
        "incident_and_risk_workflows": "Security and safety programs, audits, and incident response are described, including escalation, mitigation, and continuous improvement processes aligned with risk management.",
        "governance_and_documentation_links": "The DPA and security documentation align monitoring with formal controls, audits, and governance structures similar to those in frameworks like NIST AI RMF and GDPR-style accountability, though not always named explicitly."

        "monitoring_scope_and_focus": "Qwen\u2019s usage policy and technical report describe moderation, safety, and logging in terms of enforcing rules and improving models, but they do not clearly distinguish system-level monitoring from potential user-level inspection.",
        "data_used_for_monitoring": "References are made to logging and analysis of content to detect abuse or policy violations, without clear statements about anonymization or aggregation for monitoring purposes.",
        "incident_and_risk_workflows": "There are general references to taking action when violations are detected, but little detail on structured incident escalation, mitigation workflows, or post-incident review.",
