        "minimization_principles": "OpenAI enforces minimization primarily through system design: role-based access, network segmentation, and reduced retention windows, particularly for API data. However, the privacy policy does not extensively coach end users not to overshare.",
        "retention_policies": "API data is retained for a short, defined period (e.g., 30 days) for abuse monitoring and debugging, and general retention is described as limited to what is necessary for services and legal obligations.",
        "internal_access_controls": "Access to customer data is restricted via RBAC, least privilege, MFA, and logging of sensitive operations, and the system card for o3/o4 indicates that routine human browsing of user messages does not occur outside of tightly-scoped safety operations.",
        "logging_and_telemetry": "Monitoring and logging are described in terms of service reliability, security, and abuse detection, but the documentation does not always emphasize minimization or anonymization of telemetry in user-facing language."

        "Short, explicit retention window for API data with defined deletion behavior.",
        "Strong internal access controls including RBAC, MFA, and least-privilege enforcement.",

        "retention_policies": "Data is retained for as long as there is a business or legal need, with deletion or anonymization afterwards, but the retention standards are high-level and open-ended.",
